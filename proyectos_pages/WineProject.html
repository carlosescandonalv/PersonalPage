          <p>Ciù Cìu, a renowned Italian wine manufacturer tasked us with conducting a 
            comprehensive customer analysis for forecasting future trends. The project 
            entails K-Means Clustering and sentiment analysis of social media sites.

           
          </p>
          <p>The project aims to understand current customer groups, most liked and disliked
             wines by brand, country, variety of grapes and tailor a business plan accordingly.
             The creation of personas and a engaging storytelling to present the data to the company's 
             board was key to the project's success.
          </p>

          <div class="section_title">The project</div>
          <p>One of the industries that are constantly growing and that is more and more dependent on
            public/online opinion is the wine industry. The rising adoption of wine among all age
            groups (from the young generation to the old age population) across the globe is the key
            factor for market growth. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global wine
            distribution. The closure and restrictions on hotels and restaurants changed the purchasing
            behavior of consumers, that turned to food retailers along with online portals to shop for
            this type of product</p>

            <img src="proy_images/WineCiuCiu/market size.png" alt="marketsize" id="market">
          <p>Nowadays, social media gathers a seemingly endless amount of information in every
            field, that is available to anyone at any time. Although it might seem simple to collect
            useful data, it is extremely challenging to make use of this wealth of information. </p>

          <p>With this background of studies, the possibility to analyze the sentiment behind wine
            reviews, as well as the most common topics that are being brought on the internet seemed
            to be the point where Ciù Ciù Tenimenti Bartolomei should focus all of its attention. </p>

          <p>Following the line of the previous section, intending to help this company strengthen the
            cooperation among all its wineries to offer the market the highest quality wines from
            different territories, the <span style= "color:blue">research question </span>chosen for analysis was the following: <span style= "color:rgb(38, 218, 241)">“When
            people are looking for wine online, what are the research keys that lead them? The brand
            of the company, the geographical area of wine production, or the grape variety?”.</span></p>
          
          <div class="image-container">

            <img src="proy_images/WineCiuCiu/researchquestion.png" alt="ResearchQuestion" id="RQ">
          </div>

          <p>By answering it and having access to the most searched words related to wine, whether
            the brand, the city/province, or even grape variety, this analysis will provide insight into
            public opinion concerning certain aspects of wine and support the decision-making of Ciù
            Ciù Tenimenti Bartolomei regarding the development of its sales strategy, including
            decisions regarding its future wine production, while knowing which type of wine to sell
            and advertise, depending on the target the company has in mind.</p>
          <p>To be able to have the necessary answers, the first step lay on a sentiment analysis through
            the <span style="font-weight: bold; color:blue"> Twitter Sentiment Analysis </span>dataset. By splitting the mentioned dataset, it was possible
            to train and test the model to classify sentiment within tweets as positive, negative,
            neutral, or irrelevant. </p>

        <section>
            <div class="section_title">Storytelling</div>
            <p>The story relies on the reality that each consumer is a whole world with different
              situations, thinking processes, taste, etc. These contrasts among people make the selling
              problem much more complicated because, Can you satisfy everyone? The answer is
              clearly no, but we believe we can get close to that point. How? By segmentation and
              clustering, dividing our market from top to bottom. For the development of this project,
              the first assumption is to consider two different types of wine consumers: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Wine – expert: Heavily invested wine consumers, medium or high knowledge
                about wine and wine related topics. Enjoy quality over quantity and wine-tasting
                is a primary focus</li>
              <li> Average consumer: Less trained in wine matter, drinkers but not well informed or
                connoisseurs of the wine industry. Differentiate less between different different
                taste, varieties or bottles. Wine buyers for a wide variety of reasons but not winetasting.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="proy_images/WineCiuCiu/marketsegmentation.png" alt="marketseg" id="marketseg">
            <p>Data collection was done according to the previous assumption. For the expert consumer,
              270k reviews acquired from Wine Enthusiast Magazine were used. This magazine
              includes wine reviews from professional sommeliers and wine-tasters, addressing
              features such as rating, price, description and variety.</p>
            <p>To approach the average consumer problem, efforts must be pointed somewhere where
              everybody as access and scrapping of data will be simple to perform - the answer is Social
              Media platforms, mainly Twitter. Using a twitter scraper tool, the goal will be to analyze
              what the general public post about wine, country of provenance, grape variety or brands,
              along with checking potential similarities with the expert criteria. The final objective
              would be to cluster, in some extent, what are the main preferences of these two big groups
              of consumers and the thinking process they follow in the acquisition of a bottle of wine.</p>

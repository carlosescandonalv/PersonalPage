          <p>Ciù Cìu, a renowned Italian wine manufacturer tasked us with conducting a 
            comprehensive customer analysis for forecasting future trends. The project 
            entails K-Means Clustering and sentiment analysis of social media sites.

           
          </p>
          <p>The project aims to understand current customer groups, most liked and disliked
             wines by brand, country, variety of grapes and tailor a business plan accordingly.
             The creation of personas and a engaging storytelling to present the data to the company's 
             board was key to the project's success.
          </p>
        </div>

        <section>
          <div class="section_title">The project</div>
          <p>One of the industries that are constantly growing and that is more and more dependent on
            public/online opinion is the wine industry. The rising adoption of wine among all age
            groups (from the young generation to the old age population) across the globe is the key
            factor for market growth. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global wine
            distribution. The closure and restrictions on hotels and restaurants changed the purchasing
            behavior of consumers, that turned to food retailers along with online portals to shop for
            this type of product</p>

            <img src="proy_images/WineCiuCiu/market size.png" alt="marketsize" id="market">
          <p>Nowadays, social media gathers a seemingly endless amount of information in every
            field, that is available to anyone at any time. Although it might seem simple to collect
            useful data, it is extremely challenging to make use of this wealth of information. </p>

          <p>With this background of studies, the possibility to analyze the sentiment behind wine
            reviews, as well as the most common topics that are being brought on the internet seemed
            to be the point where Ciù Ciù Tenimenti Bartolomei should focus all of its attention. </p>

          <p>Following the line of the previous section, intending to help this company strengthen the
            cooperation among all its wineries to offer the market the highest quality wines from
            different territories, the <span style= "color:blue">research question </span>chosen for analysis was the following: <span style= "color:rgb(38, 218, 241)">“When
            people are looking for wine online, what are the research keys that lead them? The brand
            of the company, the geographical area of wine production, or the grape variety?”.</span></p>
          
          <div class="image-container">

          </div>

          <p>By answering it and having access to the most searched words related to wine, whether
            the brand, the city/province, or even grape variety, this analysis will provide insight into
            public opinion concerning certain aspects of wine and support the decision-making of Ciù
            Ciù Tenimenti Bartolomei regarding the development of its sales strategy, including
            decisions regarding its future wine production, while knowing which type of wine to sell
            and advertise, depending on the target the company has in mind.</p>
          <p>To be able to have the necessary answers, the first step lay on a sentiment analysis through
            the <span style="font-weight: bold; color:blue"> Twitter Sentiment Analysis </span>dataset. By splitting the mentioned dataset, it was possible
            to train and test the model to classify sentiment within tweets as positive, negative,
            neutral, or irrelevant. </p>
            
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="section_title">Storytelling</div>
            <p>The story relies on the reality that each consumer is a whole world with different
              situations, thinking processes, taste, etc. These contrasts among people make the selling
              problem much more complicated because, Can you satisfy everyone? The answer is
              clearly no, but we believe we can get close to that point. How? By segmentation and
              clustering, dividing our market from top to bottom. For the development of this project,
              the first assumption is to consider two different types of wine consumers: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Wine – expert: Heavily invested wine consumers, medium or high knowledge
                about wine and wine related topics. Enjoy quality over quantity and wine-tasting
                is a primary focus</li>
              <li> Average consumer: Less trained in wine matter, drinkers but not well informed or
                connoisseurs of the wine industry. Differentiate less between different different
                taste, varieties or bottles. Wine buyers for a wide variety of reasons but not winetasting.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="proy_images/WineCiuCiu/marketsegmentation.png" alt="marketseg" id="marketseg">
            <p>Data collection was done according to the previous assumption. For the expert consumer,
              270k reviews acquired from Wine Enthusiast Magazine were used. This magazine
              includes wine reviews from professional sommeliers and wine-tasters, addressing
              features such as rating, price, description and variety.</p>
            <p>To approach the average consumer problem, efforts must be pointed somewhere where
              everybody as access and scrapping of data will be simple to perform - the answer is Social
              Media platforms, mainly Twitter. Using a twitter scraper tool, the goal will be to analyze
              what the general public post about wine, country of provenance, grape variety or brands,
              along with checking potential similarities with the expert criteria. The final objective
              would be to cluster, in some extent, what are the main preferences of these two big groups
              of consumers and the thinking process they follow in the acquisition of a bottle of wine.</p>
          </section>
          
          <section>
            <div class="section_title">Results</div>
            <p>As depicted in the figure on the left, it is important to keep in mind that the top wine 
              manufacturer when it comes to expert reviews belongs to the US. Italy and France wines 
              arise in the following places, followed by Portugal and Spain. These might be considered 
              the most relevant countries regarding wine production, and therefore the main 
              competitors of Ciù Ciù - the ones the company should focus its attention on.</p>
              <h3 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.7rem;">First step - Expert Reviews</h3>
            <p>Figure 4 illustrates the top reviewed grape 
              varieties of the thousands of experts' reviews 
              collected, from where is possible to claim 
              that Pinot Noir is the grape variety that 
              generates more reviews, followed by 
              Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Red 
              Blend, and Bordeaux-style Red Blend.  This 
              information transmits to Ciù Ciù several 
              insights related not only to the products the 
              company should invest in but also related to 
              the pricing strategy the company can pursue. </p>
            <div class="image-container_2">
              <img src="proy_images/WineCiuCiu/countries_wine.png" alt="Countries" id="countries">
              <img src="proy_images/WineCiuCiu/grape_wine.png" alt="GrapeVariety" id="grape">
            </div>
            <p>By knowing the most wanted grape varieties for the 
              different areas of the provenance, Ciù Ciù can have a different price 
              strategy for its wine, usually for a higher price than the average one of the 
              countries of production. The previous figure argues that wine tasters 
              do not mind spending more for one of the most popular varieties of each country if price 
              is compared to the mean of each country entire set of variety choices. </p>
            
            <img src="proy_images/WineCiuCiu/wineprice_percountry.png" alt="wineprice" id="wineprice">
            <p>As a title of example, it is possible to verify that, if wanting to expand to France, Ciù Ciù 
              would be able to charge a higher price when compared to the remaining countries. From 
              this same Figure, it is also possible to conclude that French wines are the ones where 
              people are willing to pay a higher price for popular varieties, and where companies with 
              good and famous varieties can practice prices relatively higher than the average one, 
              which might be a sign of a good country to invest hereafter.</p>
            <p>Moreover, experts tend to attribute a higher rating to French and Italian wines, being their 
              most popular varieties and the most expensive when compared to the remaining countries. 
              They would fit expensive-taste consumers but also demanding ones. As already referred, 
              this analysis might give Ciù Ciù insights about pricing differences according to the 
              country of origin, and also that production in low economic power countries could led to 
              a cheaper market price in those wines.</p>
            <p>More precisely, contrary to France and Italy, lower prices are charged both for Spain and 
              Portugal. Therefore, if Ciù Ciù intends to invest in these two countries, young people with 
              not so much economic power could be a good target group to consider. Contrarily, by 
              focusing its strength on Italy and France, the company can target people with more 
              expensive tastes. </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, it cannot be neglected the fact that in Portugal (e.g.), varieties with a very 
              high rating are available, coupled with a wide variety of prices, meaning it is a country 
              possible to fit all types of personas, for all types of occasions. As for the US, the latter 
              can be seen as the “middle ground” between Portuguese&Spanish and French&Italian 
              wines. </p>
            <p>Going into more detail, we can found here the most common words for the positive reviews. As expected, <span style="font-weight: bold">Cavernet Sauvignon</span> grape variety, together with <span style="font-weight: bold">Pinot Noir</span>, stand out in the positive opinions of experts, along with words such as <span style="font-weight: bold">“fruit”</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">“flavor”</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold">“black cherry”</span>.

              It is also noteworthy that brand names and provinces are not mentioned that much and instead people seem to be more concerned and look more for flavors and grape varieties. More specifically, people tend to search more for fruity, cherry, and red/blackberry flavors, with a clean finish.
              </p>
            <div class="quote">
              “This is an impressively ripe and solidly fruity wine. (…) Cabernet Sauvignon (…) it is the brilliant black fruit that gives this wine its real character and density. It is impressive”.

            <img src="proy_images/WineCiuCiu/wordcloud.png" alt="wordcloud" id="wordcloud">
            
            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.7rem">Second step - Average Consumer<i class="fa-brands fa-square-twitter" style="color:#1DA1F2;;padding-left: 2%"></i></h3>
            <p>For a general insight of what the average wine buyer thinks about wine, a general scrape 
              was conducted to further analyze the disparities between the opinion of normal wine 
              consumers with the one from experts. For that, 27 thousand tweets were scrapped through 
              the hashtags #wine, #redwine, and #whitewine – to attain general information on the first 
              place.</p>
            <p>After splitting into categories, it is curious to notice that the red wine falls mostly on the 
              positive tweets, contrary to the white one, that mostly appears on negative comments. 
              Furthermore, negative reviews provide clues that what consumers focus on to rate a wine 
              is 'taste' however they lack in identifying its features. Positive labeled tweets also entail 
              words such as 'great' 'day' and 'enjoy' from which we can analyze that the average 
              consumer has a tendency of associate good life experiences with a cup of wine, for 
              example, in a context of celebration or social gatherings. </p>
            <p>Following the type of wine, it is important to recall that “Brand” was not an attribute very 
              present in experts' reviews. Therefore, the ensuing brands from the “World's Most 
              Admired Wine Brands 2021” were scrapped from twitter to allow further analysis:  </p>
            <p>Around 20 thousand tweets were scrapped, ending with a high number of irrelevant 
              sentiments, probably due to advertisement or even spam. Positive reviews show to be 
              double as negative reviews. However, it is noteworthy to mention that some of the most 
              shared words on social media are the same for both emotions. It is possible to extract that 
              the average consumer identify brand, especially when it is an exclusive one, such as: 
              Penfolds, Beringer, or Tignanello, that make the top three of most tweeted words when 
              talking about the positive labeled reviews. These three brands are all renowned wine 
              manufacturers from Barosa Valley (Australia), Napa Valley (USA) and Toscana (Italy), 
              having a wide variety of wine prices and varieties. </p>
            <p>One of the main bases of this project must be the wine provenance or the country where 
              the wine is manufactured. As previously seen in the 'sommelier' reviews from Winemag, 
              there is clearly a top 5 of countries that lead the wine production.  Therefore, finding if 
              the average consumer talks about the country of provenance and what topics he mentions 
              when sharing his opinion on social media is a crucial point.</p>
            <p>For this matter, tweets with the word wine and the country or nationality (e.g., wine + 
              Italy or Italian) were searched for. After, the most frequent words for each were studied, 
              filtered and clustered to get a better insight on the data that matter the most. Around 22 
              thousand tweets were secured in total, with positive comments for each country 
              exceeding, in every case, the negative, irrelevant and neutral labeled comments.</p>
            <p>The following step was to figure out what the average consumer talks about when using 
              the wine country of manufacture in a positive or negative observation. To get these 
              insights, a word cloud and the top frequent words for each of the top 5 countries was 
              performed - where, clearly, some common words do not contain valuable information. 
              However, looking closely at each country allow to identify some characteristic features 
              that the average consumer talks about when writing a good or a bad review and that 
              provides some interesting insights. Figure identifies and clusters some of them.</p>
             <img src="proy_images/WineCiuCiu/country_insights.png" alt="countryinsights" id="countryinsights">
            <p>Every community scrapped share a very positive approach to winetasting (especially 
              when talking about Italy and France), along with red wine, that is mentioned in every 
              positive dataset, while white wine is not mentioned. Talking about taste is also identified 
              in every scrapped community, which leading to assume that words like smell or the type 
              of wine (fruity/acid) are not considered that much by the average consumer, contrarily to 
              the previous expert-reviews analyzed.</p>
            <p>It is important to highlight that when talking about a country, the average consumer also 
              mentions the region where the wine comes from, or even a popular grape variety of this 
              country, matching the one extracted in the first step of the project from wine experts.  </p>
            <p>Going into detail, it is visible how Italian sparkle wines are not well appreciated by the 
              general public, as well as prosecco, which is a typical white wine in Italy. When analyzing 
              negative reviews, the word “grape” is observed in both Spain and France, probably 
              meaning those countries grape varieties are easily identified by the general buyer to an 
              extent and can be distinguished when they do not taste as usual. </p>

              <p>Following the story line and by gathering all the above information, it is possible to give 
                Ciù Ciù Tenimenti Bartolomei a more objective view. For this, examples of target groups 
                and bottles of wine that each one is likely to seek will be presented.  
                Let the following 3 personas be considered: </p>

              with the counterpart that he does not have a lot of money to spend. However, he enjoys a 
              good bottle of wine.</p>
            <div class="prediction">
              <span style="font-weight:bold">Prediction:</span> This will be a case that gathers insights from expert reviews analysis and 
              average consumer scrapping. Price would be a limitation, but quality a seeking 
              property, reason why Italian and French wines would be discarded. Assuming the 
              popularity of red wine is bigger, Pedro would go for Spanish or Portuguese red wines, 
              varieties with high reviews and low-price brands. The most probable choice is a variety 
              like Tempranillo of Riojas brand, for around 6 €.

            <p>Celine is a 55-year-old woman who is having some friends over for a fancy dinner next

              contrarily to Celine, who is no connoisseur and does not know anything about wine 
              tasting.</p>
            <div class="prediction">
              <span style="font-weight:bold">Prediction:</span>  This situation will lead Celine to go all out for pricy wines, which are also 
              reviewed as Italian or French, following the tendency of money = quality. As an 
              amateur in wine, she will probably not have a preference among white or red wine. 
              Either Chardonnay or Nebbiolo varieties are well known and following brands like 
              Louis Roederer or Barolo, which could comprehend in a range of 35 to 100$.

              wines, but he cannot afford them with his actual salary. Nevertheless, John does not want 
              to look cheap.</p>
            <div class="prediction">
              <span style="font-weight:bold">Prediction:</span>  As a young man living on his own, he cannot overspend, so Italian and

              Noir from a United States not renowned winery, which may cost him around 30$.

              <p>To summarize all findings, it is vital to understand that you cannot satisfy everyone, but 
                that is possible to get close to that point.  The first step to do that is to understand the two 
                segments analyzed (experts and the average consumer) prioritize different features when 
                purchasing a bottle of wine. As expected, experts tend to focus on more specific features, 
                such as the grape variety, the acidity/fruitiness, and even the finish, while the average 
                consumer focus on more general aspects, like the taste (if it feels good, or not), and tends 
                to know only the most famous varieties, not always being able to differentiate them easily. </p>

              <p>In the end, the most important step of core of the report was to answer the following: 
                <span style="color:rgb(38, 218, 241)">“When people are looking for wine online, what are the research keys that lead them? 
                The brand of the company, the geographical area of wine production, or the grape 
                variety?” </span>The truth is that, even though factors like price and special occasions influence 
                the choice of a bottle of wine, both segments look more online for the variety of the wine, 
                followed by the country, and lastly by the brand, the latter being practically irrelevant. 
                When it comes to the variety, the two groups have a common preference, Pinot Noir. </p>

              <p>Lastly, concerning the country, people have preferences regarding the region of the wine. 
                In Portugal, the preference falls in Douro region, and in Spain population tends to give 
                the first place to wines from Rioja. Going to Italy, the favorite region is Tuscany (very 
                good insight for Ciù Ciù), paired with Barolo (direct competitor for Ciù Ciù production). 
                Regarding France, the top place is attributed to Bordeaux or even Burgundy. Going 
                further in the globe, Napa Valley arrives as preferable region in the US. If Ciù Ciù intends 
                to produce in other parts of the world, these regions would be good places to investigate.</p>
